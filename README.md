# GroceryListAppJS
This is a website app I built that takes in the user's input for each item they want to add to their grocery list. The strings are stored in an array, only with un-null values. When the user clicks on the "Add" button to submit, the input field is blank and the string is added to the array. When the user wants to see all of the items displayed, the user clicks on the "Show Grocery List" button. This displays all of the items in an unordered list. There are also 2 different ways for a user to change the colors of the button (user input) and text area (color picker).
